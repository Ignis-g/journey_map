# journey_minimap
Python required. 

You need https://github.com/vsantiago113/ReadWriteMemory/tree/master/ReadWriteMemory. 
You also need the full sized OOB maps from qtzl3000 on the wiki, the out of bounds sections (4096x2048). 

Rename them level_00.webp to level_07.webp and place them on the same level of this script. 

Journey needs to be running before you start the script.

This is a first draft, it works pretty well on a 1920x1080 monitor. Maybe Tower needs some work still.
